# CRESCENT CVM-Web

## Introduction

This is the development code for the [CVM-Tools web interface](https://cvmweb-albfa-xk4p5bggbtl6-1199205512.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/). CVM-Tools is a Python 3 tools package developed to support the Cascadia Community Velocity Model (CVM) working groupâ€™s effort in constructing a three-dimensional representation of subsurface material properties for the Cascadia region. These tools facilitate the storage, extraction, and visualization of the CVM through uniform and self-contained data formats.
